## Adding a new RTL language

If you end up enabling translation support for a right-to-left (RTL) language,
be sure to add the language's ISO 639-1/ISO 639-3 codes (add both if the
language has both) to the `rtl` list in `databags/alternatives.json`:

```json
{
    "rtl": [..., ISO 639 code here, ...]
}
```

The `page.html` template uses this databag to decide if the page should be
displayed as RTL. If your new RTL language isn't in the databag, it will be
rendered "mirrored" to how it should be, like left-to-right languages are.
