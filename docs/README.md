# Onion Launchpad

Onion Launchpad is a customizable landing page for organizations and
individuals to advertise their onion addresses to their audiences. The landing
page is easy to navigate and describes to users how to connect to an Onion
Service.

The landing page is based on [lego][] and offers [localized][] content about
how to download [Tor Browser][], connect to the Tor network, and access an
Onion Service.

It's a statically built website that can be easily deployed.
