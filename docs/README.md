# Onion Launchpad

![](assets/screenshot.png "Onion Launchpad")

[Onion Launchpad][] is a customizable landing page for organizations and
individuals to advertise their onion addresses to their audiences. The landing
page is easy to navigate and describes to users how to connect to an Onion
Service.

The landing page is based on [lego][] and offers [localized][] content about
how to download [Tor Browser][], connect to the Tor network, and access an
Onion Service.

[Onion Launchpad][] is useful both as a censorship circumvention tool and as a
landing portal for onion-only sites that needs to include documentation for
their users about how to get access.

It's a statically built website that can be easily deployed.
